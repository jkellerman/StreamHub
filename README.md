## üí≠&nbsp;My process

This app originally started as a project completed on Frontend Mentor with my own twist, as seen in the [original version](https://streamhubtvv1.vercel.app/). Subsequently, I found it intriguing to incorporate additional features for my personal use, ultimately leading to a complete revamp of the app, resulting in Version 2.

V2 consolidates all movies and series from the most popular streaming platforms in the UK into a single platform, making it easier to keep up with current trends. I introduced extra features, such as randomly selecting content based on user preferences like movie or series, genre, and streaming service. The new version also incorporates trailers for an enhanced viewing experience.

### What I learned

In the second iteration, I concentrated on specific areas to enhance my skills. Being around more seasoned developers in a professional enviroment gave me exposure to writing cleaner react apps. I therefore placed emphasis on refactoring the components in this app to enhance manageability and maintainability.

Additionally, my professional experience threw me into the realm of making design decisions on the fly without a design template, so I wanted to take this opportunity to trust my skills more. I'm certainly not a designer or aiming to be but it has given me some confidence to trust my own judgement when it comes tweaking and adapting for better ui/ux.

Another crucial aspect of my learning journey was delving deeper into documentation. I seized the opportunity to thoroughly explore the TMDB API documentation and discovered that the API offered features beyond my initial expectations. This deeper understanding allowed me to infuse more creativity into the application, resulting in a more customised and feature-rich experience.

## üë®‚Äçüíª&nbsp;Continued development

There are some tweaks and additional features that can be added to the project, which I may get around to in future.

- Add some state management for geolocation so can users can view streaming platforms based on their country.
- Intergrate a backend so users can bookmark movies/series.
- Add placeholder for background Image. The background Image for movie/series needs to be resized for different screen sizes, my implementation at the moment is using the picture & source html tags and fetching the different images sizes from tmdb. Next.js can optimise them for you but there is a limit on how many can be optimised on their free plan. As a result, I am not using NextImage component which handle placeholders for you. Will need to find a workaround for this.
